## Example student submission for programming challenge. A few things: 
## 1. Before submitting, change the name of this file to your firstname_lastname.py.
## 2. Be sure not to change the name of the method below, classify.py
## 3. In this challenge, you are only permitted to import numpy and methods from 
##    the util module in this repository. Note that if you make any changes to your local 
##    util module, these won't be reflected in the util module that is imported by the 
##    auto grading algorithm. 
## 4. Anti-plagarism checks will be run on your submission
